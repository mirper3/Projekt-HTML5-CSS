                "Note: Just sharing my honest thoughts and humble opinion. Today all social media and mainstream media platforms are buzzing about FireEye breach. FireEye has been open and honest about it.
                Everyone who works in security industry knows that it can happen to anyone. All of my security industry colleagues have got a challenging task of protecting the organisation against constantly evolving
                threats and threat actors. They work really hard to do their best within existing constraints ranging from limited budget, resources, cultural issues, talent gaps and not to forget technical debt
                inherited due to legacy.
            <p>
                I really find it extremely disappointing that as soon as a breach happens everyone starts blaming the organisation without realising that critical functions in the
                'victim organisation' would be facing most challenging times of their career handling the breach. Will we behave same way if one of our neighbour has a robbery at their home?
            </p>
            <p>
                Or a fellow citizen
                has an accident? Not really, we show empathy and offer support during those situations. This is not an opportunity to get likes and get your social media feed going. This is the time to show empathy,
                offer your help and lend a helping hand. Remember it can happen to anyone!"
